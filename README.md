# godot-grave-remade
HeartBeast's Hack and Slash tutorial for GameMaker: Studio 2, remade in Godot 3.4.

**This little project** is my first approach on Godot, an open source game development engine. Rather than just following tutorials, i want to try to build up an old tutorial as a pratical thing to see if i could understand my first lines of code in Godot, while engine differences and simplifications apply.

The ultimate objective is to aim to create a (nearly) identical reproduction of said source material, no matter which programming patterns i may end up use.

The videos were made around June - September 2018, and are years far before HeartBeast switched to Godot for his future game development, but the tutorial content itself is pretty compatible.
